# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to document campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals, and in particular plays. The goal of the analysis is to provide context for previous and future campaign efforts.   

## Analysis and Challenges

The analysis consisted of two parts, a review of outcomes based on kickstarter (a) launch dates, and (b) goals (outlined below). Data, consisting of several performance types in addition to plays, were in MS Excel format provided by the organizers of the University of Texas Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp. Data were analyzed using a MS Excel pivot table.
